# The ODC Documentation Sprint

The goal of this print project is to improve the ODC's documentation.

- Some tasks will have already been identified where we know the documentation need improvement, these will be listed in the issues already (see [A big list of small tasks](#a-big-list-of-small-tasks) below)
- Typos arenâ€™t likely to be listed as issues, but spotting them and submitting pull requests to fix them is welcome!
- Even raising suggestions for ways to improve the documentation for beginners is useful, so if you find something confusing let us know! Simply open a new issue in this repository with what you found difficult and the team will get back to you.

## Intro to pull requests

For first starters, have a read of the GitHub docs on [how to create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

This will help you understand how to edit some simple documentation pages and how to get that change accepted into the main codebase, and published to the documentation site.

## A big list of small tasks

There's a [GitHub Project that lists tasks here](https://github.com/opendatacube/datacube-conference-2021/projects/1).

If you would like to do one, grab it, put your name on it, and move it to the 'in progress' section. Contact Alex Leith if you need to get access to this project.

## Improve datacube-core docs

The Datacube-Core project uses Restructured Text. [Here's a guide](https://thomas-cokelaer.info/tutorials/sphinx/rest_syntax.html).

You can [read the documentation here](https://datacube-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and when you find something that doesn't make sense, click the "Edit on Github" button to go to the file and make your changes. Creating lots of small pull requests and assigning Alex Leith to them will mean that your change is more likely to get quickly accepted.
